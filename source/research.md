#Research statement#

Currently, source code is treated like plain text.
This is wrong.
It poses great problems when it comes to understanding it.
Understanding is the first step before changing it.
My goal to change this.

I am currently part of the [COPE](http://cope.eecs.oregonstate.edu) project.
Our aim is to improve the lives of software developers by understanding the practice of code changes.
Considering change and program elements as first class citizens is one way of achieving that.
