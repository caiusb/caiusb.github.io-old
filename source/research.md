#Research statement#

Currently, source code is treated like plain text.
This is wrong.
It poses great problems when it comes to understanding it.
Understanding is the first step before changing it.
My goal to change this.

My current work is on improving parallel software development.
I am looking at merging practices with the hopes of reducing conflicts and improving their resolution.
I am also interested in software testing, especially mutation testing.
